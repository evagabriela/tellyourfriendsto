# Getting Started

This site is a static HTML site that just randomly shows 1 element at random on page load.
Javascript will randomly pick an element and toggle the CSS to show it.

Each snippet is called a 'tell'.
It can be a simple thought, a suggestion or an action.

You can interact with tells by clicking:

1. External links
2. Clickable words that show/hide additional context or educational tidbits.
3. Clicking on hashtags to refresh the page in that category of hashtag.
4. Watching a video
